<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug.  It involves incorrect nesting of elements within a table.</p><code><table><tr><td>This is okay</td></tr><tr><td>This is also okay</td></tr></table><table><tr><td>This is wrong</td></tr></table></code><p>The bug is that the second table is missing an opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag.  This is unusual because it's less of a syntax error and more of a structural error that can be hard to spot. Most browsers will still render something, but it'll be unexpected and potentially cause layout issues or accessibility problems.</p>
